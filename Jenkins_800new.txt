Jenkins
===========
This is a tool used for implementing CI-CD

Stage in CI-CD
====================
Stage 1 (Continuous Download)
------------------------------------
Whenever developers upload some code into the Git repository
Jenkins  will receive a notification and it will download 
all that code.This is called as Continuous Download

Stage 2 (Continuous Build)
-----------------------------------
The code downloaded in the previosu stage had to converted
into a setup file commonly known ar aritfact.To create this 
artifact jenkins uses certain build tools like ANT,Maven etc
The artifact can be inthe format of a .jar,.war..ear file etc
This stage is called as Continuous Build

Stage 3 (Continuous Deployment)
-----------------------------------
The artifact created in the previous stage has to be deployed into
the QAServers where a team of testers can start accessing it.
This QA environment can be running on some application servers like
tomcat,Weblogic etc.Jenkins deploys the artifact into these application
servers and this is called Continuous Deployment

Stage 4 (Continuous Testing)
-----------------------------------
Testers create automation test scripts using tools like selenium,UFT etc
JEnkins run these automation test scripts and checks if the application
is working according to clients requitrement or not,If testing fails
JEnkins will send automated email notifications to the corresponding
team members and developers will finx the defects and upload the modifed 
code into Git,Jenkins will again start from stage 1

Stage 5 (Continuous Delivery)
-----------------------------------
Once the application is found to be defect free Jenkins will deploy it
into the Prod servers where the end user or clinet can start accessing it
This is called continuous delivery

Here the first 4 stages represent CI (Continuous Integration)
the laste stage represents CD (Continuous Delivery)
